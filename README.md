More info on the objectives can be found [here](https://github.com/becodeorg/gnt-verou-1-26/blob/master/2.The-Hill/3.Weather-App/README.md).

## Objectives

### Must-have features

- Enter the city of choice
- Clicking on SUBMIT or pressing ENTER should display the weather
- Weather forecast of 5 days
- The app must responsive and mobile friendly

### Nice-to-have features

These are a combination of features given by the instructor as well as features added by myself.

- Use the API of [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) to show a photo of the city they entered in the form
- Animated weather conditions
- Display of time and date

## Tools

- VS Code
- JSON
- Tailwind css
- Vanilla JS
- Animations from [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/)
- Geolocation

## Extra notes

There are a couple of new concepts that are added to this exercise that haven't been used before.

- The big new feature is the use of api's. I used the [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/)-api to retrieve the weather data
- When visiting the page, you are being asked to allow to give your location (by Geolocation). By accepting this you will get the weather forecast of your location.
- In stead of using static images given by the api, I used animated images I retrieved from LottieFiles. I had to use the switch function for different scenarios.
